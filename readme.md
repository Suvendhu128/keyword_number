# Keyword Generator
This is a simple HTML and JavaScript code that generates a random keyword from a list of keywords.

## Usage
To use this code, first create a file named index.html. Then, create two additional files named style.css and script.js. The style.css file should contain the CSS styles for the HTML elements, and the script.js file should contain the JavaScript code for generating the random keyword.

Once you have created these files, you can open the index.html file in a web browser to see the code in action.
